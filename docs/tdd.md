# Test Driven Development
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach in which test cases are developed to specify and validate what the code will do. The gist of the TDD is to write failing test cases before writing a class and write the code to make the test pass.

### Steps
- Write a failing test cases
- Write the code or functionality
- Refactor to make the test pass

In essence, TDD is Red Green Refactor.
